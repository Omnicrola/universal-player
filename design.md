# Design Doc

## Objective
Using common psychological manipulation game design mechanics, incentivise the player to progress to the end of the game, while also making them the agent of their own manipulation.

## Main Mechanic
* Hitting "Play" will use X rewards to potentially win Y rewards
* If there are no rewards, player can buy credits to Play and earn rewards them (not enabled until upgrade)
* Fairly quickly, an auto-play feature should be introduced

## Upgrade Flow Tree
All upgrades increase the engagement (even if not visible). Adjusting the random reward percentage too low or too high will cause the engagement to fall. Optimal reward is around 16%.
